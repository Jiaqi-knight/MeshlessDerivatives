Useful for plotting. Uses the WLSQM meshless method.

The bounding box of the x data is automatically used as the bounds of the generated regular grid.

Parameters:
    x : rank-2 array, dtype np.float64
        Point cloud, one point per row. x[i,:] = (xi,yi)

    F : rank-1 array, dtype np.float64
        The corresponding function values. F[i] = F( x[i,:] )

    nvis : int
        Number of points per axis in the generated regular grid.

    fit_order : int
        Order of the surrogate polynomial, one of [0,1,2,3,4].

    nk : int
        Number of nearest neighbors to use for fitting the model.

Return value:
